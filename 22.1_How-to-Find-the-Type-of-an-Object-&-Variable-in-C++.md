## How to Find the Type of an Object in C++?

In C++, every variable and object has a type. Itâ€™s often useful to be able to determine the type of an object at runtime, especially when dealing with complex codebases.

To find the type of an object in C++, we can use the **typeid** operator provided by the **type_info** library.  The typeid operator returns a reference to a type_info object, which can then be used to get the name of the type.

The below example demonstrates the use of the typeid operator to find the type of a given object in C++.

```c++
// C++ program to demostrate how to find the type of an object

#include <iostream>
#include <typeinfo>
using namespace std;

class Hari {
private:
        int a;
        float b;
public:
    Hari(void){
        a = 10;
        b = 20;
    }
};

class Harry {
private:
        int c;
        float d;
public:
    Harry(void){
        c = 10;
        d = 20;
    }
};

int main()
{
    // Creating a Hari class object
    Hari video;
    // Creating a Harry class object
    Harry blog;

    // We can also use typeid to find the type of a C++ variable
    // Declaring an int and a double
    int myInt = 10;
    double myDouble = 20.0;

    // Use typeid to find the type of myInt variable
    cout << "Type of myInt is : " << typeid(myInt).name()<< endl;   // Type of myInt is : i

    // Use typeid to find the type of myDouble variable
    cout << "Type of myDouble is : "<< typeid(myDouble).name() << endl;   // Type of myDouble is : d

    // Use typeid to find the type of 'video' object
    cout << "Type of video is : " << typeid(video).name() << endl;   // Type of video is : 4Hari
    // The number 4 indicates the length of the class name Hari
    
    // Use typeid to find the type of 'blog' object
    cout << "Type of blog is : " << typeid(blog).name() << endl;   // Type of blog is : 5Harry
    // The number 5 indicates the length of the class name Harry
    
    return 0;
}
```
