- In C++, **.hpp** and **.cpp** files are used to separate the ***declaration*** and ***implementation*** of classes and functions. 

- This separation helps in **organizing the code**, **improving readability**, and **facilitating code reuse**.

## .hpp Files (Header Files)

- **Header files** contain declarations of classes, functions, variables, and other entities. These declarations tell the compiler what exists and what not, but does not tell how they are implemented.

- Typically includes ***class definitions***, ***function prototypes***, and ***macro definitions***.

- Included in **.cpp files** or **other .hpp files** using the `#include` directive. This allows the compiler to access the declarations and use them in the corresponding source file.

## .cpp Files (Source Files)

- Contain the **implementation** of the functions, classes, and variables that were declared in the header files.

- Includes the **actual code** for the functions and methods.

- Compiled to create the **final executable**.


## Example

### test.hpp

```cpp
// Adding a Function Prototype
int add(int a, int b);

// Adding a Class Declaration
class MyClass {
public:
    void greet();
};
```

### test.cpp

```cpp
#include "test.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

void MyClass::greet() {
    std::cout << "Hello from MyClass!" << std::endl;
}
```

### main.cpp

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "test.hpp"

int main() {

    int result = add(3, 4);
    std::cout << "The result is: " << result << std::endl;

    MyClass object;
    object.greet(); 
    return 0;
}
```

## Compilation

Make sure to compile all the files together:

`g++ test.cpp play.cpp -o example`

This command will compile **main.cpp** and **test.cpp** together and link them into an executable named **example**.

## Run the Executable

Run the executable by typing the following command in the terminal:

`example.exe`
